  description: "\n        Greetings from a very hot and sultry\nNew Orleans. The music is much like the weather - ever present: it's\na wonderful vibe!\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">I'm here to photograph the New Orleans\nJazz & Heritage Festival, and this being my 34th\nfestival, I'm very familiar with the Crescent City, in fact I've\nspent well over a year of my life here, and it doesn't feel a day too\nlong.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">I can say that even after all this time\nit's just as exciting! With such artists as Simon & Garfunkel,\nAnita Baker, Lionel Richie, Joe Lavano, Terence Blanchard to name but\na few. And to come this weekend we have Aretha Franklin, Jeff Beck,\nElvis Costello, Dee Dee Bridgewater to capture just a few headliners\nfrom the some 400 plus bands appearing over the whole festival.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Best of the fest so far was the 'Voice\nof the Wetlands All Stars' featuring Tab Benoit, Anders Osbourne,\nCyril Neville, Dr John & George Porter Jnr, - that really was\ncooking! The one to watch for me is trumpeter Shamarr Allen whom I\nsaw playing with Terrance Simien's Zydeco Experience last weekend,\nbut is with his own band The Underdawgs this Saturday.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Blues man Luther Kent with his big band\nTrick Bag, takes no prisoners in the small intimate Monkey Hill bar\non trendy Magazine Street, a perfect end to the two festival\nSaturdays. They play until the wee small hours, and give a lasting\nmemory of sight and sounds that goes on forever!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"> </p>\n        "

  description: "\n        Some 9 months have passed since I sold Redferns to Getty Images; the most frequently asked question (by far) 'I suppose you're just taking it easy now?'<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth! I’d never wanted to retire, if you have a passion for photography and it's lifestyle, then there is no cut off date. Much time has been spent renovating my building in West London, upgrading my flat and most importantly preparing the ground floor for our showroom that my partner Suzy & I are opening at the end of October.<br /><br />Yes, I have sold all my pictures (was the only way I could get a deal), but most importantly I have the use in perpetuity of my favourite 1000 images to market as fine art prints, and for my partner Suzy to use in her fashion textile business <a href=\"http://www.suzyreed.com\" target=\"_blank\">Suzy Reed Ltd</a>.<br /><br />The festival season started extremely well for me as usual with my 33rd attendance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, my first time as a 'Getty photographer' a challenge I relish, did a session with Vasti Jackson as a model for some generic Jazz & Blues pictures, it was first time that I'd really put my new Nikon D300 to the ultimate low light test; street scenes at night with no flash, I think it passed with flying colours! The French festivals, Vienne, Juan & Nice followed in that order, this enabled me to add some 80 artists to my new contemporary collection.<br /><br />I've just sold 11 giant images to be permanently placed in the newly refurbished Elgar room at the Royal Albert Hall, and they are giving me an exhibition in the amphi corridor at the end of the year. Talking of exhibitions, October the 9th see's the opening of \"The Spirit of Jazz\" at the Getty Images Gallery, Eastcastle Street central London, this is in association with Ronnie Scott's 50th Anniversary and features 11 of my pictures. I also have two pictures in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition 'Beatles to Bowie: the 60s exposed' (Oct 15th - 24th Jan 2010)<br /><br />Buy for now! Preferably some of my pictures.<br /><br />David Redfern\n        "
